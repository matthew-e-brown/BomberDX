# BomberDX
**Please read the [User Guide](https://github.com/matthew-e-brown/BomberDX/blob/master/Documents/User%20Guide%201.1.pdf) before playing, as there is no tutorial.**

This was my final project for my Grade 12 programming class at Bayside Secondary School. It was written by myself and my brother, [@nick-a-brown](https://github.com/nick-a-brown), alongside design and graphics from [@neosndt](https://github.com/neosndt). It is an arcade game which involves bombing enemy bases on a remote island.

Included in the documents folder are a few of the Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator files that were used to make some of the assets. Notably, it also includes the User Guide's `.PDF`.
