# BomberDX
**Please read the User Guide before playing, as there is no tutorial.**

This was my final project for my Grade 12 programming class. It was created along with [@neosndt](https://github.com/neosndt) (Design and Graphics) and Nick Brown (Supplementary Code). It is an arcade game which involves bombing enemy bases on a remote island.

Included in the documents folder are a few of the Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator files that were used to make some of the assets. Notably, it also includes the User Guide's `.PDF`.
