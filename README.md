# BomberDX
This was my final project for my Grade 12 programming class. It was created along with @neosndt (Design and Graphics) and Nick Brown (Supplementary Code). It is an arcade game which involves bombing enemy bases on a remote island.

This repository has directories to run the game in Java for both Windows 32- and 64-bit versions. It also includes all of the source code for the game. 

Also included is the documents folder, which holds a few of the Adobe Photoshop / Illustrator files that were used to make some of the assets. Notably, it also includes the User Guide's .PDF.

## Please read the User Guide before playing, as there is no tutorial.
